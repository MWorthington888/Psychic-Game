Word Guess Game

* This is a word guessing game, much like "Hangman".

* The computer will randomly pick a word from an array and the user will type letters they think are in the mystery word.

* The game will track correct and incorrect guesses.

* If the user guesses the word before they run out of guesses, they win.

* If the user runs out of guesses before they solve the word, they lose.

* Wins and loses are tabulated and the game will reset.


* Dev notes: The program was created to help us learn objects, methods and functions, as well as reinforcing Javascript, CSS and Bootstrap syntax.
